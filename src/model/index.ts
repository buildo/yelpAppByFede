/*

You may write here any type that you want to re-use in you application.

ex:

export type Foo = {
  bar: number
}

and in any file:

import { Foo } from 'model'

const foo: Foo = { bar: 5 }



Here we define a type `CurrentView` and two helper functions that are used
in the example app created by default:

*/
export default undefined;
